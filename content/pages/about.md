**I'm Kate and I use she/her pronouns.** I'm a software developer by day, a sassy wife and pet mother by night, and a feelings-haver at all times of the day; sometimes going so far as to overshare on the internet in [one form ](https://www.aggressivelymediocre.dev/)or [another](https://twitter.com/kateypical).

Somehow always posting pictures/videos of my [two year old German Shepherd, Moose](https://twitter.com/kateypical/status/1255610425128833024), and occasionally videos of my [wheezy old man cat, Turtle](https://twitter.com/kateypical/status/1257722985407901698), living his best life.

My partner (who I'll affectionately refer to as "J") and I jumped into the minimal-ish lifestyle and small-space living world about 5 years ago and we currently inhabit the largest contiguous space we've had since we started down this path:

- ~~A 50 sq ft camping tent while we built a "tiny house" on 12 extremely raw acres about an hour from Portland. (Summer 2015)~~
- ~~A 204 sq ft off-grid cabin/shed/tiny house (not at _all_ as glamorous as anything you may have seen on TV) on the same acreage. (Fall 2015 — Summer 2016)~~
- ~~A 100-ish sq ft bedroom of my inlaw's house for a short period while I finished up a [local coding bootcamp](https://www.alchemycodelab.com/). (Fall 2016)~~
- ~~Another 100-ish sq ft bedroom we rented from friends to help them save for a baby. (Winter 2016)~~
- ~~An 86 sq ft vintage fiberglass Amerigo travel trailer on our only-slightly-less raw 12 acres. (Early 2017 — Spring 2017)~~
- ~~A 70 sq ft "bed shed" (the original tiny house was our project workshop at this point) on our still-extremely-raw 12 acres, making the vintage trailer our daytime working space. (Summer 2017)~~
- ~~A 400 sq ft apartment in SE Portland while we house hunted. (Fall 2017 — Spring 2018)~~
- ~~Small, rotating portions of an 1,100 sq ft fixer-upper we were fortunate to be able to purchase in SE Portland while remodelling the fixer-upper [ADU](https://www.buildinganadu.com/what-is-an-adu) in the backyard. (Summer 2018 — Spring 2019; while remodelling the ADU)~~
- The 425 sq ft ADU in the backyard of the aforementioned house. (Spring 2019 — Present; remodelling the house through to Summer 2019)
